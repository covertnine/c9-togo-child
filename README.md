# C9 Togo Child Theme
The C9 Togo Child Theme works with the C9 Togo theme as its parent. If you're more comfortable developing from within a child theme versus using the [client folder](https://c9.covertnine.com/documentation/c9-client-boilerplate/) as we outline on the [online documentation](https://c9.covertnine.com/documentation/), then this child theme will queue up everything you need so your theme changes are not overwritten during theme updates.

If you want to make the C9 Togo theme customized for a client site, we recommend making use of the client folder within the parent theme.
